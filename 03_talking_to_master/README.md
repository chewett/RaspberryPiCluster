Rasperry Pi Cluster project - 03 Basic node communication between two nodes
===========================================================================


In this tutorial we build a very basic one way communication method to send data from the slave to a master.

The basis of any cluster is being able to collaborate and communicate between nodes. This initial implementation
of this will create a connection between a master and slave node and send data from slave to master.
The master will print out any messages recieved from the slave. The slave will send a message every 10 seconds
with a message.
