Raspberry Pi Cluster project - 11 Automatic Slave Reconnection
==============================================================

This tutorial focuses on changing the slave so that it will
automatically reconnect to the master if the connection is lost.

With this addition the slave will automatically reconnect to the master
no matter how many times it has been restarted. This moves
the cluster one step forward towards a system which will 
automatically repair if there is an issue.

The next tutorial will focus on looking at how we can make
the cluster code run on boot using rc.local.
