Raspberry Pi Cluster project
============================

This repository holds the code for [the tutorials](https://chewett.co.uk/blog/category/raspberry-pi-cluster/) for creating a Raspberry Pi Cluster in Python.

Here I go through the basics of creating a simple logger to a distributed task assigned system.

Each tutorial will have a github release and tagged version. These can be found
[on github](https://github.com/chewett/RaspberryPiCluster/releases).
This will make it easy to download the code for each tutorial.

The first few topics will start simple and continue to improve.
Later we will get onto more complicated topics such as reaching a consensus of who must "lead" the cluster.

Questions comments and suggestions can be raised the specific blog post or by using issues here.
