Rasperry Pi Cluster project - 06 Sending Slave Details to the Master
====================================================================

This tutorial focuses on modifying the original data sending functions
to use a more generic format.

This will allow the master to read what messages are being received and
determine what action it needs to take for each message type.

Once this is done there will be a versatile system for receiving messages
from a node and processing them.

In the future tutorials I will look into creating a two-way dialogue between
the master and slave.
