Raspberry Pi Cluster project - 07 Sending data to the Slave
===========================================================

This tutorial focuses on improving the slave by being able to request
data from the master.

This will be further worked on in future tutorials to keep a state of the
cluster in each slave node.

In the next post I will look at adding a few more payloads to let the master
control the slave further. These will form the basis of the master requesting
the slave to perform computation.
