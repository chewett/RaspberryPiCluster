Rasperry Pi Cluster project - 04 Configuration Files with ConfigParser
======================================================================

Here I am using moving some of the configuration data from being hardcoded into the scripts into configuration files.

As I deploy the scripts to the nodes I don't want to have to change the scripts for each node.
Instead I am going to use configuration files to store data specific to the node such as the name of the node.
By using a specific configuration parsing module we can easily keep track of variables that are required
to be stored.
